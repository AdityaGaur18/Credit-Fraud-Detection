# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project uses **Machine Learning** to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.  
It is based on the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset, which contains anonymized features of transactions.  

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Handling imbalance, scaling, and cleaning.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Distribution, correlation, fraud vs. non-fraud analysis.
3. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
4. **Evaluation** – Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC curve.
